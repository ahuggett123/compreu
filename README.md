# Goals
The immediate goal of this project would be to estimate trends of electron density of nitrogen across graphene sheets, with the focus of assessing the compoundâ€™s ability to catalyze reverse combustion.  These polycyclic graphene compounds have shown affinity for CO2 but their ability to catalyze reverse combustion reactions, which will  consume CO2 and produce hydrocarbon fuels, has yet to be evidenced.  Previous experiments have shown the ability of pyrimidine to react with carbon dioxide in solution to produce formaldehyde.  

By modeling the energies and geometries of the unbound lone pair electrons of nitrogen when localized in such graphene compounds, insight may be discovered with the overall goal of designing carbon nanofiber based methods of converting greenhouse gases into hydrocarbon fuels.
